The image on the left depicts the initial board. The right depicts the end of the game.

The game is played on a 3 x 3 grid of squares. <br/>
You can choose either X or O as your character, but your opponent has to pick a different one. <br/>
Either you or your opponent can start. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. <br/>
Whoever gets 3 of his/her marks straight in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner. <br/>
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie. <br/>
